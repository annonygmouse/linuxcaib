#/org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/disable-user-switching

#Remember that users can access the command line from other parts of the desktop as well. If you want to disable any kind of access to the command line, you will have to remove entries for GNOME Terminal and any other kind of terminal emulator (xterm, rxvt, etc) from the main menu. You will also need to disable the Deskbar applet from the panel lockdown options since it lets users execute commands.
